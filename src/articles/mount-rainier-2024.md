Thanks to my friend Lura, fulfilled a Pacific Northwest dream and made it on – not up, on – Mount Rainier!

I was anxious about avoiding wildfire smoke, and now [trips to National Parks need to be pre-booked](https://www.recreation.gov), so opted for the end of June rather than later in the summer. There was some panic later when I realized that [trails were most likely still snow-covered](https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/trails-and-backcountry-camp-conditions.htm) and while some were, for the most part everything was traversable with a good pair of boots.

Unbeknownst to me there was [a hotel on the mountain](https://mtrainierguestservices.com/accommodations/paradise-inn/) – there's an additional hotel to the south and lower down, the [National Park Inn at Longmire](https://mtrainierguestservices.com/accommodations/national-park-inn/)

Both sides of Myrtle Falls along the Edith Creek:

Another excellent waterfall along the [Silver Falls Loop trail](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/silver-falls-loop) around the mountain:
