Took a week and headed to Portland to wander around; I'd been a few times, but didn't explore as much as I'd like. There were a few complications – a heat wave, a delayed train, a misplaced bag, a few bad falls on trails – but a great time was had and I'd definitely like to visit more places in Oregon now, including [Crater Lake](https://www.nps.gov/crla/index.htm).

Portland has a lot of terrific parks – Mt. Tabor and Washington were gorgeous and extensive:

I took a day trip out of Portland with [EcoTours of Oregon](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g52024-d783914-Reviews-Eco_Tours_of_Oregon-Portland_Oregon.html), which was a great way to see the sights but also to learn about the environmental history of the area. The Columbia Gorge was clouded over on the morning of the trip:

Multnomah Falls is as spectacular as they say, but all the other falls along the Gorge are also amazing:

By the afternoon Mount Hood was sunlit and spectacular – the Timberline Lodge is wonderful.
