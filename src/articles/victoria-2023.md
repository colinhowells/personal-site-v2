Headed to [Victoria](https://www.tourismvictoria.com) with my mum, which she'd never seen … If you go, I'd recommend taking a water taxi – or walking, if you don't mind a long walk – to [Spinnakers, a terrific brewpub](https://www.spinnakers.com).

Harbor, day and night:

There now sits a [Finnish-style sauna, in a boat](https://www.havnsaunas.com), tied up at the harbor, which will have to wait until the next visit:

Obligatory [British Columbia Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_Parliament_Buildings) shots:

[Butchart Gardens](https://www.butchartgardens.com) I was dubious about, but it was truly spectacular:

My mum does not enjoy being photographed, but I got shots of her being well pleased with the dahlias nonetheless:
