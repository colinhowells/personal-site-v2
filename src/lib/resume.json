As a project manager, I often find that designers can be tricky to work with because of their work styles, attitude, personal design opinions and ego. Every time I’ve collaborated on a project with Colin, however, there have never been issues like this. In fact, he brings a complete openness to each and every project, with zero personal agenda. He always takes the time to understand the goals of the campaign and needs of the client. In fact, often Colin has taken the energy to grasp the concepts of the overall campaign so well, that he brings new and valuable perspective which ultimately manifests in an improved vision. His work style and attitude are truly refreshing and I’ve never been disappointed with the work he’s turned out."

He is a talented designer, who pays attention to detail and works extremely well under pressure. He can analyze projects not only from a creative point of view, but also from a very broad and goal-oriented perspective. The financial success of my division could not have been attained without his hard work, knowledge and dedication."
