Some of these have been optioned for years, like _The People’s Act of Love_ and _The Sparrow,_ but I doubt they’ll ever get made.

### James Smythe’s _The Machine_

A science fiction novel featuring the titular Machine, a large but obscure piece of furniture which can remove memories but also may be able to reinstantiate them. This plays as a very Cronenbergian conceit, in which the actual technologies aren’t as much the point as their potential for misuse. One haunting detail is that this future is one in which climate change has already wreaked severe damage but it’s no longer remarked on, just part of life at that time.

### Mary Doria Russell’s _The Sparrow_

There is an SF subgenre of First Contacts That Go Horribly Wrong of which this is a proud member. First you have to accept the idea that Jesuits are the plucky astronauts, which is a bit counterintuitive and maybe unnecessary, but after that the disaster that follows is wonderfully appalling. Another novel with some similar themes is China Mieville’s _Embassytown_ which I can also recommend.

### James Meek’s _The People’s Act of Love_

Amazing tale of the Russian Civil War that immediately followed the Revolution with its armies, hardscrabble lives of peasants, and horrendous Arctic prisons, with appearances of a bizarre religious sect and Polish nationalists. (Meek’s _To Calais in Ordinary Time_, another historical novel, is also fantastic.)

### Ben Kostival’s _The Canyons_

[The Colorado Coalfield Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Coalfield_War) were truly terrible conflicts in which mine owners slaughtered mine workers, sometimes using memorable means like armored ‘death trains’. A similar tale was told in John Sayles’ _Matewan_ in 1987 (out of print and unstreamable! Again!), but this novel felt more like a Terrence Malick film to me – the vast andscape and its silences are always present, the dialogue sparse and gnomic.

### Carter Scholz’s _Radiance_

I think, but aren’t sure, that Bruce Sterling might have mentioned this in a list of undeservedly-obscure novels (along with Raphael Carter’s _The Fortunate Fall_). Undeservedly obscure it is – it’s a hilarious story of political schemers incessantly fighting for influence and funding for ever-more-complex weapons systems in a Lawrence Livermore-like lab in the early ’90s. I do think this might work better as a film than as a novel, not because the novel isn’t terrific but because it’s written in a style that seems a little too indebted to late Gaddis (_Carpenter’s Gothic, A Frolic of His Own_).

### Madison Smartt Bell’s Haiti trilogy

There have been a few films of the Toussaint Louverture story, but none that seems commensurate to the events. The Haitian Revolution – the only successful slave rebellion in which not one but two empires were beaten off! – features here in near-Tolstoyan scope. I love _Dune_ as much as the next Butlerite but this story truly deserves two or three IMAX films, and the Bell novels are marvelous paths in.

### Daniel Kehlmann’s _Tyll_

I’m cheating here as this _is_ being filmed for TV by the _Dark_ people, but I’ll believe it when I see it. The novel (set during the Thirty Years’ War and featuring a cast of historical personages) has an ingenious structure which might be difficult to pull off visually – each chapter takes place at a different point in time in the narrative, and stands somewhat alone; the pleasurable connections you draw between them take place in your mind. To pull all those threads out and reweave them chonologically I think might deprive the material of some power.
