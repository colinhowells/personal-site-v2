This year, two big experimental novels championed by [The Untranslated](https://theuntranslated.wordpress.com) and published in English by the same publisher – _Solenoid_ and _Schattenfroh._ Both very long books are to me disguised memoirs, which is an interesting choice but which is probably inevitable if you are a committed surreal author in need of material who also has some personal history they need to expurgate. _Solenoid_ is the gentler of the two, more magic-realist in tone; I thought it was excellent and memorable (though overly long). _Schattenfroh_ is a much burlier (even more overly long) beast, filled with absolutely extraordinary imagery which might be only fully clear or significant to the author. Even with a lot of preparatory reading, and following [extremely helpful notes](https://theuntranslated.wordpress.com/2025/10/03/a-readers-guide-to-schattenfroh/), it was still rough going at times. Not being deterred, and maybe being a glutton for punishment, next year some more monster novels arrive in the post from the same publisher [Deep Vellum](https://www.deepvellum.org).

I really wanted to like [_Chevengur_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevengur) – the critical response to its reissue was extremely positive – but it left me somewhat cold, most likely because its tone doesn’t come across well in translation and also because I think it requires more cultural (ie Russian) knowledge than I have to appreciate. I’m chalking this up to my inability to grasp it rather than some deficiency of the text.

The big surprise for me this year was Emmanuel Carrère. He’s doing what _should_ make me dislike him: regarding events past and present through a personal lens, turning an examination of history (in this case the New Testament with a focus on Luke) into mere memoir. Despite this I was carried along effortlessly; he’s absolutely terrific and I’m looking forward to getting to his book on the [Bataclan-attacks trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks) in the coming year.

Pierre Michon continues to be incredible; I’ve been reading one of his a year, and this coming year I’ll read his novel – really a novella? All of Michon’s books are extremely short – on Rimbaud.

_Buddenbrooks_ was fantastic. I found it very difficult to put down, which I hadn’t expected as I thought he had a reputation for being dense and ponderous. It may be that those tendencies lie in wait for me in _The Magic Mountain_ and _Doktor Faustus,_ copies of which are at hand whenever I get back to reading books set in Germany.

One of my big initiatives this year was to catch up on France prior to WWI, and that was – still is, as of 2026 – really rewarding. Stendhal was frankly a bit silly but his project of castigating France in the moribund 1820s pre-July Monarchy was amusing. Moving on to the Second Empire (which interested me due to strong resemblances to the present day), Zola like Stendhal knew how to capture an audience’s interest but his deep research and his commitment to rousing some rabble to address societal faults (rather than simply lampooning them) makes him really compelling, though he can occasionally overreach and be ridiculous.
