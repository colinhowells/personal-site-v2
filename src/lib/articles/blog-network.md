An excellent way of reaching our audience was promoting articles via social media; in the time this network was maintained, massive players entered, thrived, and withered, while we kept successfully on (even acquiring once-competitors), a tribute to the loyalty of our users.

A decision early on was that every cause focus have its own brand – respecting the users’ preferences; people are often passionately focused on a single issue or area of concern – which necessitated a number of sites, around 60 at the network’s peak. At the time, there weren’t many good ways to handle content franchising in a WordPress context (we’d committed to WordPress long before) – now, there are things like [10Up’s Distributor](https://distributorplugin.com), and multiple-domain multisite is much simpler to configure. A bespoke solution allowing us to franchise content was devised by us which worked really well for what was needed.

This project was a learning experience over many years that involved many classic web-development problems – but most of all, third-party integrations: advertising, analytics, recommended-content widgets, embeds from many different vendors… Making sure the users, the company, and the third parties were all getting the experiences and timely data they needed was a real challenge. Every once in a while [a terrific talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFvTCiIDwMM) or a [useful tool](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/zaraz/) appears, but this struggle isn’t talked about in the profession nearly enough.
