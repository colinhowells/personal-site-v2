Took a week and headed to Portland to wander around; I'd been a few times, but didn't explore as much as I'd like. There were a few complications – a heat wave, a delayed train, a misplaced bag, a few bad falls on trails – but a great time was had and I'd definitely like to visit more places in Oregon now, including [Crater Lake](https://www.nps.gov/crla/index.htm).

Portland has a lot of terrific parks – [Mt. Tabor](https://www.travelportland.com/attractions/mount-tabor-park/) and [Washington](https://explorewashingtonpark.org) were gorgeous and extensive:

I took a day trip out of Portland with [EcoTours of Oregon](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g52024-d783914-Reviews-Eco_Tours_of_Oregon-Portland_Oregon.html), which was a great way to see the sights but also to learn about the environmental history of the area. The Columbia Gorge was clouded over on the morning of the trip:

[Multnomah Falls](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/crgnsa/recarea/?recid=30026) is as spectacular as they say, but there are [countless falls along the Gorge](https://www.hood-gorge.com/how-to-guide--waterfall-corridor) including [Latourell](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Latourell_Falls_Loop_Hike):

Hood River is a beautiful little town along the Columbia, frequented by windsurfers (this is a terrible shot as my phone at the time was old):

By the afternoon Mount Hood was sunlit and spectacular – the [Timberline Lodge](https://www.timberlinelodge.com) is wonderful.

The Portland [Rose Garden](https://www.portland.gov/parks/washington-park-international-rose-test-garden) (which I photographed many times but none of them do a good job of conveying the sheer number and variety) and [Japanese Garden](https://japanesegarden.org) lived up to billing and then some:
