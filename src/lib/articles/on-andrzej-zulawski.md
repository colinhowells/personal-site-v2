The Polish film director Andrzej Żuławski is known by people who like strange movies for one film, 1981’s _Possession._ I’ve been interested in Eastern European films more and more, and decided I needed to spend some time with Żuławski (along with fellow Poles Wojciech Jerzy Has, Agnieszka Holland, Jerzy Kawalerowicz, and Andrzej Wajda) beyond that film.

Żuławski’s films are in a state of near-constant frenzy; actors are forever rushing about, declaiming, bursting into diatribes and screaming. (Depending on how you see French cinema, it may confirm your impressions about it that once Żuławski’s second film _The Devil_ was banned in Poland in 1972, he kept working in France.) Żuławski’s world cries out for tranquilizers, rather than fluoride, in the water supply – emotional states are febrile, changing drastically for reasons which aren’t quite apparent, at least in the earlier films. Meditative arthouse cinema this is not.

There are also many strangely inappropriate, transgressive, and inadvertently hilarious moments – in _On the Silver Globe,_ during a quasi-medieval battle in which infantry are being run through with swords, the musical cue would better suit a calm morning with birdsong; in _The Public Woman_ an actor delivers lines while breathing circularly, for no discernable reason, and that technique is later used by an actress delivering lines for a film to intensify a scene; a character who otherwise is sober and restrained in _The Blue Note_ spends a few minutes in close-up gurning and twisting his face into expressions seemingly meant to entertain toddlers. Heinrich in _Possession_ arrives at Mark’s apartment searching for his lover Anna (Mark’s wife) – on being told gleefully by Mark that Anna is most likely in the arms of yet another lover, Heinrich gamely continues polite conversation while gyrating in what looks like an improvised dance routine, drug withdrawal, or Parkinson’s.

The viewer however does have the sense that Żuławski might have a rationale for these decisions (is ‘the creature’ speaking through Heinrich, possessing him?). David Lynch is a director with many formal similarities but who seems to work much more intuitively. Lynch makes nonsensical decisions that _feel_ justified, but one suspects Żuławski arrives in similar places by planning his route. Some of the pleasure in Żuławski’s films is trying to discern his logic, which with time becomes less baffling or Brechtian and more delightful – in _The Blue Note_ characters interact with large puppets of themselves, which could be a neat metaphor for our deliberate crafting of a personality and affect suitable for public consumption.

1991’s _The Blue Note_ is a marvelous film, and deserves a dedicated paragraph: set in a riotous summer at George Sand’s country house in 1847, the year of the dissolution of Frédéric Chopin and Sand’s rather toxic and codependent relationship, and this central thread is followed (and severed) in the film, surrounded by _Rules of the Game_-style bedhopping by houseguests famous and not. (A film that covers the meet-cute early days of the Sand–Chopin relationship is _Impromptu,_ directed by James Lapine also in 1991 from a terrific script by Sarah Kernochan.) Along with the aforementioned puppets another stroke of brilliance is the score, which is nearly constant throughout the film and seems to reflect what Chopin hears in his mind, as his attention drifts away from conversation or anything distressing (which is, unfortunately for him, everything). He interrupts the stream by periodically making it diagetic – sitting down at a fortepiano and picking up immediately from where the soundtrack leaves off (Jerry Garcia remarked that Dark Star was always playing; the Grateful Dead just joined in progress). Classical music has defeated many filmmakers who are often not able to convince viewers that the actors they see are actually playing music. For this film Żuławski was extremely fortunate to have Janusz Olejniczak playing Chopin, who was not only a talented actor, not only a very capable pianist who could play from memory, not only able to improvise at length in a Chopinesque manner, but also physically resembled Chopin. (Olejniczak was also the hand double in Polanski’s _The Pianist,_ and only recently passed in October of 2024.) A repeated theme in the film is Chopin’s musical expression of turmoil, the pounding arpeggios of which everyone hears as extremely disturbing and decidedly nonmusical.

The emotional extremity of Żuławski’s scenes are reflected in the way they’re shot; he’s renowned for handheld camera work, which is assured and adds a tremendous wallop to scenes. Handheld and verite cinematography is a hallmark of low-budget and foreign films, but in Żuławski’s case he’s not only making the best of a destitute situation, it suits the tone and material. The camera sweeps through sometimes-complex blocking to land precisely where it needs to be; its movement draws attention to itself, but not to the exclusion of what you’re actually watching – this is not a cinema of extremely long and applause-worthy choreographed takes. In the earlier films, some scenes smear into a Francis Baconesque fluid nightmare, an uncanny artifact of the combination of the camera, its lens, the film stock, and a touch of undercranking, and is amazing to see (_The Devil_ especially). Subsequent films discard this technique, but with _Fidelity_ in 2000 it returns, this time as still images: the photographer Clélia favors heavily blurred, distorted, and oblique portraits.

Emotional intensity is communicated in other nonverbal ways: actors will at times resort to squeaking, rather than speaking intelligibly, as if they have suffered cerebral trauma due to events and language is now lost to them. Pressure is high in these films, a certain kind of pressure: social coercion. Characters are trapped in inescapable-for-them situations in which their agency is limited by others, and will shriek when conflicting demands can’t be met. Sometimes the coercion is made explicit when the character is engaging in something close to prostitution, sublimating whatever they might want – assuming they know what that is – to transactional relationships, or practically being owned (or Possessed). Characters struggle to clear space for themselves alone, but that freedom is nearly impossible to attain, comes at extremely high prices, or is ultimately risible: Solange Sand in _The Blue Note_ produces amateur work derivative of her mother and her mother’s favorites while ostensibly cultivating independence; Ethel in _The Public Woman_ is only an actress under duress and abuse, work which she is unsuited for despite her being perfect in other ways; Nadine in _That Most Important Thing: Love_ is desperate to finally do work of real artistic value but the production she’s in is eviscerated in the press.

Another form of coercion appears in the weight of history: Żuławski is understandably preoccupied with Polish history and the threat of erasure Poland lives with to this day. _Possession_ (obstensibly a spy story, which is easy to forget while watching it) features repeated shots of East Berlin border guards staring listlessly at the protagonist’s window in the West. _The Devil_ takes place during the Second Partition, and Prussians roam the country picking Polish nationalists off. Poles lamenting their exile feature prominently in _The Blue Note._ In _The Public Woman_ Russians use Czechs to eliminate Lithuanians, and while Poland isn’t mentioned the comparison hovers. (There are of course countless nuances and allusions I’m missing in these films, having a limited grasp of Polish history, and not speaking Polish or French and often having to make do with not-great translations.)

History hovers around the films, but also literature: most Żuławski films are (extremely loosely) based on some extant work, and alongside that framework appear a collection of references and quotations from others. Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky are favorites, and Auden is a fixation of a character in 2000’s _Fidelity,_ which allows for long quotations from wonderfully allusive erotic poems like this one from around 1930:

### Poem XVII

This lunar beauty  
Has no history  
Is complete and early;  
If beauty later  
Bear any feature  
It had a lover  
And is another.

This like a dream  
Keeps other time  
And daytime is  
The loss of this;  
For time is inches  
And the heart’s changes  
Where ghost has haunted  
Lost and wanted.

But this was never  
A ghost’s endeavour  
Nor finished this,  
Was ghost at ease;  
And till it pass  
Love shall not near  
The sweetness here  
Nor sorrow take  
His endless look.

Sexuality pervades nearly every scene in Żuławski’s films, and sex is treated in a very adult – if extremely gratuitous – way: the reasons characters desire each other have a bewildering variety. Actresses are asked to travel to extremes, not just extremes of exposure (Valérie Kaprisky in _The Public Woman_ is nude or nearly so throughout) but real emotional distress (Isabelle Adjani was rumored to have attempted suicide after completing _Possession_). It’s hard to imagine Żuławski having the career he had today – but then one remembers Charlize Theron, or Nicole Kidman, or Emma Stone, who all successfully venture where Adjani went years before. As frightening as all this can be, these are consenting adults making the trip.

Żuławski’s career was repeatedly circumscribed, limited, and interfered with by Polish authorities, which explains the _idée fixe_ of being constrained. The ultimate example of this was the shutdown of production in 1977 of _On the Silver Globe._ When you watch what eventually got released in truncated form ten years later, you have some sympathy for the financers: it resembles _Apocalypse Now_ in that its megalomaniacal scope threatens to expand beyond reasonable bounds (and also features a feral, amoral society of near-children in the wilderness). It adapts a series of SF novels by Żuławski’s great-uncle, which required rocket ships, half-human half-bird aliens, and masses of extras with elaborate costumes. Some of what is on screen is silly, but you have to admire the industry – like the best European SF the special effects might be dodgy (or nonexistent: one character carries a laser-gun-like weapon but which is never fired, only waved) but the imagination and the ability to make do with limited resources is top-notch (an alien world is conjured by simply tinting the film negative). You can see echoes of the film in many SF films now – Lynch’s _Dune,_ or any ’80s post-apocalypse film a la _Mad Max_ – but the film often grinds to a halt to allow characters to expound on philosophical conundrums which get more and more maddening every time a new episode occurs. Żuławski edits himself into the film’s conclusion, lamenting the lost effort and what might have been. One wonders however how the film if completed would be regarded – like _Solaris,_ or _Ishtar?_
